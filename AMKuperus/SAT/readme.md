# StudentActivityTracker

As of today the **SAT-project** has moved to [my personal Github](https://github.com/AMKuperus/SAT).
Reason for the move to my personal Git is that it will be easier for me to monitor progress to the project over time.

If you're interested in following the **SAT-project** you can follow the progress from [there](https://github.com/AMKuperus/SAT).
