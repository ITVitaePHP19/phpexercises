###StudentActivityTracker

As of today the SAT-project has moved to my personal Github and can be found in the codeStash.
Reason for the move to my personal Git is that it will be easier for me to monitor progress to the project over time.

If you're interested in following the SAT-project you can follow the progress from there.
